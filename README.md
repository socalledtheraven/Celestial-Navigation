# Celestial Navigation Calculator
A tool for using star sightings with a sextant to determine your position. A tool designed for that most relatable of situations, your GPS breaking but your sextant and laptop with a copy of this program working.

This should work during 2023, but since the almanac doesn't go farther than that, no promises otherwise. Please don't use this in a serious navigation scenario, it's a proof of concept.

## Features
- User-friendly interface.
- Removes all calculation steps from cel nav process.
- Input order resembles the paper forms traditionally used, and will be familiar to any navigator.
